Walking home from the biergarten, something hit me in the kopfkino. I was
immediately knocked to my knees in the middle of the Hauptstrasse.
A Schneewittchen BMW had thrown something at me!
I fell forward and dropped my Bratwurst and Brot.
He was bumping Rammstein Musik in his car.
I was quite upset, how could this happen, I thought to myself. Then I realized I am in Berlin. 
Forunately, a nice lady wearing a Dirndel and Lederhosen offered to buy a new one.
So I followed her to the nearest Ratskeller. As soon as we walked in, I saw two
guys wearing lederhose in a wettbewerbsfaehig game of darts.
Lenderhose in this how room without Klimeanlage? No wonder the Ratskeller smells like Bratwurst. 
What has happned, whispered to myself. I miss Brunswick. Why did you leave us Gauss? Were you too busy, as I was, to realize the beauty of our home? I regret the minute my plane took off GmbH and landed in this 6 billion dollar "flaghafen".
