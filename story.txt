Walking home from the biergarten, something hit me in the kopfkino. I was
immediately knocked to my knees in the middle of the Hauptstrasse.
A Schneewittchen BMW had thrown something at me!
I fell forward and dropped my Bratwurst and Brot.
He was bumping Rammstein Musik in his car.
Forunately, a nice lady wearing a Dirndel and Lederhosen offered to buy a new one.
